# House Price Prediction Model with MLOps Integration
## Project Overview
The **House Price Prediction Model** is an advanced machine learning project that leverages cutting-edge MLOps practices and powerful ML tools to predict house prices. This system integrates ZenML and MLflow for pipeline orchestration, experiment tracking, and model deployment. We follow industry-standard practices such as modular code design, model versioning, and automated pipelines to ensure reproducibility and scalability.
The project includes comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and model building pipelines. It also implements best practices in machine learning, such as model validation, hyperparameter tuning, and handling of missing data and outliers.
By incorporating MLOps, the project ensures continuous model monitoring, deployment automation, and streamlined collaboration across teams.

## Installation Guide
### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
To isolate your project dependencies, it’s highly recommended to set up a virtual environment. You can follow this guide to create and activate a virtual environment: [Virtual Environment Guide](https://youtu.be/GZbeL5AcTgw?si=uj7B8-10kbyEytKo).
### 2. Install Project Dependencies
After activating your virtual environment, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Install ZenML Integrations
To enable integration with MLflow, ensure that you install the necessary ZenML integrations:
```bash
zenml integration install mlflow -y
```
### 4. Configure ZenML Stack
ZenML is used to manage the project’s machine learning pipeline. Set up a ZenML stack with the following commands:
```bash
zenml integration install mlflow -y
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
zenml stack register local-mlflow-stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --set
```
## Key Features
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Gain deep insights into data through visualization and statistical methods.
   - Use **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas** for effective analysis.
   - Detect patterns, correlations, and potential issues with the data.
### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Handle missing values using multiple strategies.
   - Perform outlier detection to ensure robust model performance.
   - Apply transformations like **log normalization** and **scaling** to improve model accuracy.
### 3. **Model Pipelines**
   - Training pipeline is orchestrated with **ZenML** for modularity and scalability.
   - Deployment pipeline is powered by **MLflow** for efficient tracking and model serving.
### 4. **MLOps Integration**
   - Full tracking of model performance and experiment results via **MLflow**.
   - Seamless model deployment and monitoring with **MLflow** and **ZenML**.
   - Version control and rollback capabilities for models.
### 5. **Design Patterns for Maintainable Code**
   - Use of **Factory**, **Strategy**, and **Template** design patterns for clean, scalable code.
   - Ensure the separation of concerns and high maintainability across components.
## Running the Project
### Running the Training Pipeline
Run the following command to execute the training pipeline:
```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```
This will:
- Ingest data
- Preprocess data (feature engineering, missing value handling)
- Train the model using the specified algorithms
- Log the experiments to MLflow
### Running the Deployment Pipeline
Once the model is trained, deploy it using:
```bash
python run_deployment.py
```
This will:
- Deploy the model to a production environment
- Set up API endpoints for predictions
### Sample Prediction
To test the deployed model, use the sample prediction script:
```bash
python sample_predict.py
```
This will:
- Load the trained model from MLflow
- Make predictions on sample data
## Design Patterns
### Factory Design Pattern
- Simplifies the process of creating various objects (models, preprocessors) based on a set of parameters.
- Centralizes object creation and makes the code easier to extend and maintain.
### Strategy Design Pattern
- Allows dynamic selection of algorithms and models at runtime.
- Facilitates easier experimentation with different models, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
### Template Design Pattern
- Provides a skeleton for pipeline steps while allowing customization for specific steps (e.g., model evaluation, data ingestion).
- Ensures consistent structure while allowing flexibility in individual implementations.
## Conclusion
This project provides a fully integrated **MLOps pipeline** for house price prediction, using industry-standard practices and cutting-edge technologies. By combining **ZenML** for pipeline orchestration, **MLflow** for experiment tracking and deployment, and utilizing solid **design patterns**, the project demonstrates how to create scalable, maintainable, and reproducible machine learning systems.
With this setup, you can easily extend the project to other prediction tasks and leverage the power of automation in your machine learning workflow.
